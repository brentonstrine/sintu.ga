        <p>My developer story gives you a short brief clue for how can I started learning computer, and how the situation changed my way. Depending on my experience computer, especially coding need more exercise and
      I learned a lot of things from try and error. Google and watching different youtube videos also help to improve our skills.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>I never touch any computer until I was graduate high school.</li>
        <li>My first job gave me the chance to access a computer, and I started teaching myself the main computer skills.</li>
        <li>Now I joined Georgia Piedmont Technical College to be a computer support specialist.</li>
        <li>After I joined the college, I became more confidential and started fixing and troubleshooting something happen on my and my friend's phone, pc, or tablets.</li>
        <li>I took one Program Design and Development course, and I became more interested in coding.</li>
        <li>I begin watching several videos on youtube related to coding.Googling also my other way to learn more.</li>
